    <p>Data used in this analysis is unpulished and
        
Where did this data come from?

The data come from Wikipedia, List of disasters in the United States by death toll .
Who has access to it?
    </p>
    <p>This project serves as part of my digital ethnography side project collaborating with other two friends. I'm in charge of data collecting and analysis to facilitate their works on participative observation and interview.
        For example, one of the finding after ploting the users' locations is that there are quite a large proportion of users actully use this service outsides US or wear those clothes to travel. We didn't notice this part of people untill the graphic showed us. Therefore, it helped a lot to modify our wishlist of research plan and focus.

    <p>The data is scraped from Instagram since official API doesn't support location information of where the photo post is taken. When instagram user post each photo, they can add many tags to make the post more searchable, so I scrape the basic information (user name, location is any, post time, etc) of all the photo which has been attached with a "Letote" tag and "Renttherunway" tag.
    As the screenshot shown below, the user "lananamendez" has tagged "Letote" in her post at Chicago Riverwalk.

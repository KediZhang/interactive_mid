    <p>Data used in this analysis is unpulished and
        
Where did this data come from?

The data come from Wikipedia, List of disasters in the United States by death toll .
Who has access to it?
    </p>




    <br><hr>
    <h4>Complete</h4>
    <p>The data is scraped from Instagram since official API doesn't support location information of where the photo post is taken. When instagram user post each photo, they can add many tags to make the post more searchable, so I scrape the basic information (user name, location is any, post time, etc) of all the photo which has been attached with a "Letote" tag and "Renttherunway" tag.
    As the screenshot shown below, the user "lananamendez" has tagged "Letote" in her post at Chicago Riverwalk.
    </p>
    <p>Not all user post the location of their photo, and here is an overview of data I obtained:</p>    
    <ol>
        <li>Renttherunway: 16,597 posts with location out of 41,352 posts (last update 4/7/2018)</li>
        <li>Letote: 3,556 posts with location out of 14,080 posts (last update 4/7 2018)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Correct</h4>
     <p>It's interesting to find that there are quite a large proportion of users actully use this service outsides US or wear those clothes to travel. We are not able to conclude whether they're overseas service subscriber or domestic users who wear the clothes during their travel. We didn't notice this part of people untill the graphic showed us. Therefore, it helped a lot to modify our wishlist of research plan and focus.</p>

    <h4>Accountable</h4>
    <p>Several patterns about fashion rental service subscribers are lised below. However, I still find the information extracted so far are limited, further works are definetly needed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RentTheRunway is popular in both metropolitian area and small scale cities when Letote's business is still constricted in big cities</li>

    </ul>
    <p>There will be more findings as my digital ethnography continues and the data analysis will definetly give insights and help our qualitative research works. Other social media platforms and forums like Facebook, Reddit and Yelp could be data resources for next steps of analysis.</p>

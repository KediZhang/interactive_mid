    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Rental fashion is emerging these year as a part of shared economy. This data visualization focus on comparing two major player in US market:
        <a href="https://www.renttherunway.com/">Renttherunway</a> and <a href="https://www.letote.com/">Letote</a>. 
        The former brand provides rental of high-end dresses for special occasions, when the latter focus on daily casual dress.
        </p>

    <p>This project serves as part of my digital ethnography side project collaborating with other two friends. I'm in charge of data collecting and analysis to facilitate their works on participative observation and interview.
        For example, one of the finding after ploting the users' locations is that there are quite a large proportion of users actully use this service outsides US or wear those clothes to travel. We didn't notice this part of people untill the graphic showed us. Therefore, it helped a lot to modify our wishlist of research plan and focus.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>About the Dataset</h4>
    <p>The data is scraped from Instagram since official API doesn't support location information of where the photo post is taken. When instagram user post each photo, they can add many tags to make the post more searchable, so I scrape the basic information (user name, location is any, post time, etc) of all the photo which has been attached with a "Letote" tag and "Renttherunway" tag.
    As the screenshot shown below, the user "lananamendez" has tagged "Letote" in her post at Chicago Riverwalk.
    </p>
    <img src="images/datasource.png" width = "100%" alt="Instagram">
    <p></p>
    <p>Not all user post the location of their photo, and here is an overview of data I obtained:</p>    
    <ol>
        <li>Renttherunway: 16,597 posts with location out of 41,352 posts (last update 4/7/2018)</li>
        <li>Letote: 3,556 posts with location out of 14,080 posts (last update 4/7 2018)</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Visualization 2: Compatibility of Genres</h4>
    <i>Question: How has the compatibility of different fusion genres changed over time? (based on number of shared songs)</i>
    <br><br>
    <p>Using this interactive chord diagram, we can examine the similarities between the fusion genres over the decades. The thickness of each chord (connection between two genres) is proportional to the number of shared songs between the genres, conveying the similarity of those genres.</p>

    <h4>Visualization 3: Compatibility of Genres</h4>
    <i>Question: How has the compatibility of different fusion genres changed over time? (based on correlation of acoustics)</i>
    <br><br>
    <p>Similarly, we can use heatmaps to gauge the similarity between genres. However, instead of using the number of shared songs as a proxy for similarity, we will now use correlation between four acoustic features (average timbre, tempo, loudness, duration) to measure similarity between genres over the six decades. Red squares indicate high correlation in acoustics, conveying similarity between the genres.</p>

    <h4>Analysis</h4>

    <i>Question: Is all the user cases inside US?</i>
    
    <img class="analysis-images" width = "100%" src="images/global.png">
    <p>It's interesting to find that there are quite a large proportion of users actully use this service outsides US or wear those clothes to travel. We are not able to conclude whether they're overseas service subscriber or domestic users who wear the clothes during their travel. We didn't notice this part of people untill the graphic showed us. Therefore, it helped a lot to modify our wishlist of research plan and focus.</p>

    <i>Question: Does renttherunway dominate across US?</i>
    <br>    
    <img class="analysis-images" height = "200px" src="images/east.png">
    <img class="analysis-images" align = "right" height = "200px" src="images/bay.png">
    <p>Left: Northeast Area and New York City</p>
    <p>Right: The Bay Area and Downtown San Francisco</p>
    <p>Renttherunway was launched in 2009 with 505 employee currently. On contrast, Letote is established in 2012 with a group of employee arounf 150. Letote is still under Series C funding, so there is gap between the volumn of two companies.
        The plots above clearly shows the dominance of RentTheRunway in east costal area. However, in the bay area where Letote was launched, ladies are open to both brands and many of them are subscribing both services (shown in orange dots).

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>Several patterns about fashion rental service subscribers are lised below. However, I still find the information extracted so far are limited, further works are definetly needed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>RentTheRunway is popular in both metropolitian area and small scale cities when Letote's business is still constricted in big cities</li>

    </ul>
    <p>There will be more findings as my digital ethnography continues and the data analysis will definetly give insights and help our qualitative research works. Other social media platforms and forums like Facebook, Reddit and Yelp could be data resources for next steps of analysis.</p>
